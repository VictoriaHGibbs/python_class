# code4.3 - Adding to 10
# In this exercise you are required to use the range function to create 
# an odd-numbered list from 1 to 9, then creates an even-numbered list 
# from 2 to 10. Finally, join the two lists (Hint: you can use the + operator!)
# Then sort the new list so it displays the numbers from 1 to 10
#
# Using the range function, create an odd-numbered list from 1 to 9


# Using the range function, create an even-numbered list from 2 to 10


# Join the two lists


# Sort the combined list


# Display all three lists
print("Odd-Numbered List (1 to 9):")
print(odd_numbers)

print("\nEven-Numbered List (2 to 10):")
print(even_numbers)

print("\nCombined and Sorted List (1 to 10):")
print(sorted_list)
