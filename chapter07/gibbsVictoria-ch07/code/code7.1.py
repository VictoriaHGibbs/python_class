# Title: Creating a Music Shop Inventory

# Objective: Write a program that asks the user to input names of musical 
# instruments for a music shop's inventory. The program should continue 
# asking for inputs until the user types 'done'. Once 'done' is 
# inputted, the program should print the complete list of
# musical instruments entered.

# Requirements:

#     Use the input() function to collect user inputs.
#     Implement a loop to continuously ask for user inputs.
#     Use a conditional statement to break out of the loop when the user
#     inputs 'done'.
#     Store all inputs in a list before 'done' is inputted.
#     After the loop ends, print the list of musical instruments.

# Hints:

#     Initialize an empty list to store the names of the instruments.
#     Use a while loop to keep asking for inputs.
#     Check if the user input is 'done' to exit the loop.
#     Use the append() method to add each instrument to the list.

# Beginning of program
#
# Initialize an empty list to store musical instruments


# Use a while loop to continuously ask for user input

    # Ask the user to input the name of a musical instrument
    
    
    # Check if the user wants to stop the input process
    
    # Add the inputted instrument to the list
    

# Print the list of musical instruments after the loop ends
